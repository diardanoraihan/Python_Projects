    "- Methodological: tools and methods for working with and understanding data.\n",
    "- Statisticians: apply and develop data analysis methods, seek to understand their properties.\n",
    "- Researchers and workers: apply and extend statistical methodology, and contribute new ideas and methods for conducting data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "__A Statistic and the field of Statistics__:\n",
    "- A statistic: numerical or graphical summary of a collection of data. \n",
    "    - Average score on final exam\n",
    "    - Minimum temperature at a location over year\n",
    "    - Proportion of people who are retired\n",
    "- Statistics: academic discipline focusing on research methodology. Statisticians develp new statistical tools, calculate statistics from data, and collaborate with subject-mater experts to interpret them. \n",
    "\n",
    "__The Landscape of Statistics__:\n",
    "Evolving and dynamic field ~ Emerging challanges and opportunities: \n",
    "- Properties of statistical methods are under continuing study. \n",
    "- New application areas -> development of new analytic methods. \n",
    "- New types of sensors -> new types of data\n",
    "- Advances in computing -> sophisticated analyses on Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "__Statistics and its Allied Fields__: \n",
    "- __Computer Science__\n",
    "    - algorithms, data structures for working with data, programming languages for manipulating data\n",
    "- __Mathematics__\n",
    "    - language and notation for expressing statistical concepts concisely, tools for understanding properties of statistical methods\n",
    "- __Probability Theory__\n",
    "    - branch of mathematics ~ crucial part of foundations of statistics - to express ideas about randomness and uncertainty\n",
    "- __Data Science__\n",
    "    - database management, machine learning, computational infrastructure to carry out data analysis.\n",
    "- __Artificial Intelligence__\n",
    "    - Statistics now is a major linchpin in research and industry. A number of different emerging applications include:\n",
    "        - Computer Vision\n",

    "## 1.2 Statistics: Perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "__The Art of Summarizing__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data can be overwhelming\n",
    "- Making sense of data usually involves reduction and summarization\n",
    "    - reduction: make a dataset comprehensible to human observer\n",
    "    - summarization: always depends primarily on goals of __data consumer__ to be meaningful -- many approaches\n",
    "    \n",
    "__Science of Uncertainty__\n",
    "- Data can be misleading.\n",
    "- Statistics provides framework for assessing whether claims based on data are meaningful. \n",
    "- Uncertainty is inevitable, but it is highly desirable to quantify how far our reported findings may fall from __the truth__. \n",
    "- I.e. many public opinion polls report results along with a margin of error to provide an idea of what that potential discrepancy wll be between the reported and the actual states of public opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Science of Decisions__\n",
    "- Understanding data is important -> only consequential if we act on what we have learned.\n",
    "- __Desicion-making__ = ultimate goal of any statistical analysis.\n",
    "- We make decisions in face of __uncertainty!__\n",
    "    - What are costs and benefits of different approaches? \n",
    "    \n",
    "__Science of Variation__\n",
    "- Often focus on most typical or __central__ value.\n",
    "    - i.e. Average American has around \\$6000 of credit card debt (central value of credit card debt in US population)\n",
    "- Great emphasis on understanding __variation__ in data!\n",
    "    - i.e. 10% of Americans have more than $30,000 in credit card debt (variation of credit card in US population)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Art of Forecasting__\n",
    "- Forecasting or prediction = central tasks in statistics\n",
    "- Cannot know future with absolute certainty, but efficient use of available data\n",
    "    - it can sometimes make accurate predictions about future!\n",
    "    \n",
    "__Science of Measurement__\n",
    "- __High accuracy__: person's age or height\n",
    "- __More difficult__: blodd pressure (varies in minute to minute)\n",
    "- __Harder__: \"mood\", \"political ideology\", \"personality\"\n",
    "\n",
    "__Basis for Principled Data Collection__\n",
    "- Data often expensive and difficult to collect\n",
    "- Resource limitations -> collect least data possible\n",
    "- __Statistics__: provides a rational way to manage this tread-off"
